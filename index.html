                <P>The origins of Jaguar can be traced back to 1922, with the Swallow Sidecar Company. Since the first Jaguar car was produced in 1935, we have pushed the boundaries of what is possible, inspired by our founder, Sir William Lyons.</P>

                <p>It produces 444 horsepower, enough to get the F-Type to 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds. The next iteration of the engine is the P550, which is found only in the F-PACE SVR. This version gets a big bump in power, up to 542 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque.</p>

                <p>Jag calls it 'the first voice-activated artificial intelligence (AI) steering wheel that will be able to carry out hundreds of tasks. ' So it's more of a tablet than a physical wheel - although it will still drive the car, when it's not in autonomous mode.</p>

                <p>Every car in the Jaguar range is available as all wheel drive. This means that in normal driving conditions, 90% of the torque is committed to the back wheels, ensuring that every one of our AWD cars retains Jaguar's dynamic rear wheel drive feel for a more enjoyable driving experience.</p>
